Run the command npm install <package-name> to do so.\r Open a terminal in the directory with the server and enter nodemon. nodemon is a tool that restarts the server if you make changes to the JS code in order to reflect the changes.\r To stop the server, enter ctrl+c in the terminal.\r Access your page in the browser. Since the server is being hosted locally on your machine, use the URL localhost:8000/hello. 8000 is the port we specified in hello.js.\r Since we told the server to serve files in the \"public\" directory, we can access our website with the url localhost:8000/hello.html.",
